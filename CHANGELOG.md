## [v2.0.0] - 2021-04-28

### Added

- Stac versions from 0.8.0 --> 1.0.0-rc.3 are now supported.
- Version is detected automatically.
- Default validation attempts to validate a core Stac object as well as any extensions.
- Recursion which was previously handled by Pystac is now done natively with both a depth option to limit the time it takes to validate and a verbose option to display output as individual objects are being validated one by one.
- Added AWS CDK deployment example.
- Added FastAPI routing to CDK deployment.

### Changed

- Pystac is now only being used to identify stac objects. Jsonschema is being used for all other validation.  
- The cli library was changed from Docopt to Click.
- Custom validation was updated to allow for local schemas.

### Removed

- The force, legacy, version, and update methods were removed.
- stac versions where a `stac_version` field is not present are
  no longer supported.

## [1.0.0] - 2020-09-01

### Added

- The ability (--update) to update a STAC object. This is based on migrate from pystac. It doesn't always work. Frequently it does. Presently it tries to update to version 1.0.0-beta.2
- A function to display what has changed via --update. This is represented in the logs as diff.
- A --force option. This updates the stac_version to v0.9.0 and adds an id field as older STAC versions seem to be missing this sometimes. This seems to be especially effective with objects as old as 0.6.0 and 0.6.1
- An option (--version) to specify and set a specific version to validate against.
- The --extension option. This uses pystac validation to validate against various extension schemas.
- The ExtensionError, as inputing a bad value for extension caused validation in pystac to be bypassed.
- The VersionError, as inputing a bad value for version was causing validation in pystac to be bypassed as well.
- The --recursive option. This uses validate_all from pystac to recursively search the links from a catalog or collection.
- The ability (--core) to validate against the core only. This is provided by pystac.
- (--legacy). This validates agains schemas from v0.4.0 to v1.0.0-beta.1 Legacy must be accompanied by --version.
- valid_versions for --legacy are: 'v0.4.0', 'v0.4.1', 'v0.5.0', 'v0.5.1', 'v0.5.2', 'v0.6.0', 'v0.6.0-rc1',
  'v0.6.0-rc2', 'v0.6.1', 'v0.6.2', 'v0.7.0', 'v0.8.0', 'v0.8.0-rc1', 'v0.8.1', 'v0.9.0',
  'v0.9.0-rc1', 'v0.9.0-rc2', and 'v1.0.0-beta.1'
- (--custom). Validate against a custom schema
- Tests to explore new functionality.

### Changed

- Updated core validation to use validation from pystac instead of jsonchema.
- With the newest version - 1.0.0-beta.2 - items will run through jsonchema validation before the PySTAC validation. The reason for this is that jsonschema will give more informative error messages. This should be addressed better in the future. This is not the case with the --recursive option as time can be a concern here with larger collections.
- Logging. Various additions were made here depending on the options selected. This was done to help assist people to update their STAC collections.
